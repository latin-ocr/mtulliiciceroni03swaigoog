in Ptys. 114they are called πά θειότατα πάν φανεράν. Taking it thus as a
collective exprefflon (amplae επ drepente menbris as is said oi Xenocrates)
we might find in itan explanation for lot ds' imadiately belovv, but see n.

tions’ Lescaloperius ia loc. See on 1 24„

uti tot dt: Heind (followed by Sch. Opaca 111 311) thinks that, ae tot
cannot apply to the four above mentioned (which in reality are only two, the
κινοῦν and κινούμενον), something must have been lost from the text; aad
es Arist is said aaa dissentire iram his master, he suggests that the lost
clause may have corresponded with § 30 quoa trojorum instatura αοοερίοεαε.
But why may we not give the same meaning to aa· tot via ‘all those many
(lods os the popular religion'‚ without suppoeing an emissioni (So dilen.)
The Epicurean objection would then bs that ‘these gods are supposed to
exist in heaven, but ii heaven itsels ie God, how can one god live in
another’l Ii we accept Soh’s conjecture that the lost clause referred to
the stare, the objection would merely bs a repetition of ecclam maadi εεοο
purtem: ‘they are already included in caelans, how can they be separate
and independent Gods¹l

numeremus: similarly m 40, 43.

semper ce movens: these words are in direct oppositicn to Aristotle's
κινεῖ dalmas, which is further explained (Cael. 11 12) εὀιεε πᾷ μὲν άριατα
ἔχοντε ὑπάρχειν τὸ εὖ άνευ πράξεως...ἔσςε ’γάρ ου’πῷ τά οὗ ἕνεκα. The Epi·
crvrean vievvs of incorporeal substance (εεειευ privat) have been sufficiently
illustrated already.

§ 34 Xenocrates: cf. Krische an-aacnw. 172. C. alludes more than
once to the complimeut pald to Xenocrates by his countrynren in aceepting
his word iu lieu οἰ, the mutomary oath Bata. 12, Ata 1 ld; he reporta his
alienor as to the aim oi his teaching, at id ευο spem jacerent qaod caye-
realarseecre leyihua Rep.13; and describes his psyohclogy in the words
avaimifiyaram et ρυαες· corpus περαοίο esse, οεευπε canaram dixit εεεες eajru
οεέ, etjam orate Pythagoras υἰευπε ενοι, ia actara πεοιεὶεπα εοεαε. Tuae. 1 20.
The account given in the text omits all that is characteristic in his philo·
sophy: sce Stob. Ed. 1 p. 62 Ξεν. τὴν μονάδα καὶ τὴνδυάδα θεοὺς (άπεφῆυαπο)
τὴν μὶν ὥς άρρεεο πατρὸς ἔχουσάν τάξιν ἐν οὖραεᾷ βασιλεύουσαν, incra

name oi Rhea to thc dyad) πῆς άπὸ τὸν eriperis λήξεως &saepiunt (‘prcsiding

Some oi these last were of a malignant character, φύσεις ἰν τῷ περιέχοντι
