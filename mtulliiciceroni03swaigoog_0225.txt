μοι. utigitur Ti. Gracchum—intellegantur. Iam disposed to
agree with Klotz (A dm 11 15) as against Madv. ap. Orelli (who is followed
by Sch Baiter end Miiller) and should translate the passage as follows: ‘ln
the same way then ss, when I imagine myself ιο see Gracchus in his speech
presenting the woting mn about (to decide the case of) Octavius, I at the
time smert this to be a mere groundlees fancy, while you on the contrary
essert that the images of the two men continue to exist, and aiter arriving
in the Capitol are then carried on ιο me‚—-so (you essert it to be) in the
ease of (lod, whose mcurring likeness strikes upon the mind and leads it
to recognize the divine blessedness and cternity '. Τιο simple framework
of the sentence would be ιιι Τι’» ammam evm miteor videre...motmn ammi

dr‘cimm epo motum inanem fieri, tv crebra focr'e pelli amireos, but O. aiter
giving both the Academia and Epicurean views in the compared csse
oi Gracchus, omits the former, es obvious, in the csse of the goda and
so confusas the construction. Madv. omits ipitvr, which connecte the
special application with the general principle, takes vta-velta, ss in 5 88
m semper and changes pervenerim into pervenerim, making Ιιοο fieri s
sortes corollnry depending on dieis understood, instead oi the spodosis of
the sentence Soh (Ν. Jahrb. 1875, p. 691) points out thnt there is nc
occasion for pervenerim, the soene might be imaginat without going to the
Capitol, though it is true s risit there might suggest it; on the ether hand
the vagrant images oi G. and 0. may be supposed to attach ιο themselves
imagee οι· the Capitol ιγ their visit there, cf. Div. 11 137 t'ate r'pitm me

is as follows In 133 nc. the passing of the Agrarian law cf Ti. Gracchus
was stopped ιγ the veto ci Octavius his colleague in the tribunate : aiter a
vain attempt to induce him ιο desist from his oppositicn, G. proposed his
deposition by the tribea When 17 out of the 35 tribes had voted ior the
motion, G. once more urged Ο. ιο yield, but he answering ‘complete what
thou hest begrm’, the voting was continued and Ο. deposed
