(mi ποις· τὸ di λοιπὸν ἄθροισμα παρασκεύασον τὴν αίτίαν ταύτην μετείληφε
roi ciri τοιούτου συμπτώματος παρ’ ἐκείνης, ori μέντοι πάντων eir ι’κιίνη
κέκτηται. διὸ ἀπαλλαγείσης τῆς ψυχῆς ουίε ἔχει τὴν αἴσθησιν· ori γὰρ eriri
ἐν ἑαυτῷ ταύτην ἐκέκτητο τὴν δύναμιν κ.τ.λ. from which it appears that the
fine atoms which form the soul end especially its purast part, the mind or
reason, which has ita seat iu the heart, (lc. 66) are the true source of
sensatim, but that they cen only act when conlinod within the body, on

. leaving which they are immediately dissipated end no longer exist as soni

Body by itself, ie. the compound of grosser atoms known to us by the
rueme of body, is incapable of sensation, but when united with the finer·
atoms of mind, it becomes sensitiva to a certain degree On the general
subject of the relation of eoul and body, of. Lucr. 111 esp. aso-287, where
he shows that either by itselfis alilre incapable of sensatione Talring this as
ourclue,1 think the only satisfactory way of getting over the difficulties of
the sentence is to suppose that the apodosis to the ind protasia has been
lost This was the view of Lambinus who inserted the clause cur αηιιαιιι
mereti before adjuravit, changing et meite into ιιιιιιιιιιι Most of the modern
editors have followed in thesemo traclr. The text which Ι have giversts
that of Baiter except that I go with lambio omitting et mne, which
seems to have arisen simply from a misreading of the abbreviated matti:
when this was once taken as an Abl. it would naturally be joined with the
pmceding senen hyan et. Soh's reading mne the first question too much
into the second; the first cor must certainly be followed by an αιῇιιιιτιιι
auditis also oaeier to account for the loss oi tho ind clauso, if its end was
an echo of tho lst How then will the argument standi The dogma
attached is, in its most general form, that the first principle is divinely
animated water ; ιο which it is objected that we have here an mneoeesary
combination of two principles : ‘il divinity is possible without feeling, why
ald mindi Why may not simple water stand for tlre first principlei On
the other hand, if mind is capable of eristing alone, unoonnocted with any
body, why tie it down to water l' It is difficult ιο deal with the argument
from the ambignity in the use of the word ‘god’. If by ‘god' is meant the
first principle, then the Epicureans would hare allowed that thie may
exist eine ιοιιιιι. in their view senseless atome are the first principles, and
they could have no a priori objection to eonseless water holding the same
office On the other hand, ifthe name ‘god’ implica personality, thenit ie
plain that the first principle of Thales was not a god. Divino persons euch
ae those whom the popular religion recognized were as subordinate in his
philosophy as they were in thet of Epicurus, but they are, certainly not “
niore opposed to the former system than to the latter. The point of the
objection seems to be that a dynamical principle, lilre thet of the older
Ionio philosophers, as opposed to the mechanical principles of Democritus
ie en irrational blending of two mntmry principles, the materialistic and
the idealistic. In this objection Plato and Aristotle would concur, both
