not have allowed that time existed even as indefinite duration before
the universe came into being. ‘With the rotation of the Kosmas began
the course of time, days, mouths and years: anterior to the Kosmoe
there was no time, no past, present or future, no numerable or measurable

motion or change’. Grote’s Plato 111 256. In Platc's own worded μέν ’
