cul ex omnihus—deus: ‘whom he would have us believe to be a ἶ

Zagroue, which woa interpreted by later philosophare ol the animo mundi
pervading the universe (Plut. M. 389 n). Simplex is an ironical substitu-

Heraclides: anutive of Heraclea in Pontus, pupil oi Plato and Speu-

sippus and altermls of Aristotle (Krische eal—³36). In the letters to
Atticus there are many allusione to the Dialogues of Her. which were

distinguished from those of Aristotls by the fact that in the former (os in
the N. D.) the author was madeo κωφὸν πρόσωπον, while in the latter he
wne the principal interlocutor (as in the Tuaculane). O. speaks of him with
respect as oz'r doctus inprimis (Tuae. v. 8), and quotes from him Dio. 146
and 130. The views here ascribed ιο him are common to the Platouic
school. We ere further told that he held with Ecphantus, the Pythagorean,
that nll material objects were compounded oi atonis, and that the apparent
movement ol the heavens wne caused by the rotatico of the earth.
