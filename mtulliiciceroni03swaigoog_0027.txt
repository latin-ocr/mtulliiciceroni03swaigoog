5110, the approving mention, slightly veiled it is true under an
Academia form, of the Stoio doctrine of the divinity of the universe
595, and of the teleological argument 5100. Schwenke carries
the argument further than thia He notices certain marks which
indicate a more or lesa 01010 following of his authority on the part
of Oioero, such as the introduction of quotations from Latin authors,
allusione to Roman anatome, 10 other writings of his own, 110. 3 and
in reference 1011111 particular section, which professes to 110 a reply
10 what has gone before, he remarks that it is very unlikely that
0. could have met with an independent 11011110, whether Academia
or 81010, which should just meet and refuta the arguments in the
Epicurean treatise used by him 101 the earlier sections; that pre
0110 references therefore to the preceding argument am probably
additions by O. 3 aud from this he draws the conclusion that the last
part of Ootta's speech, 110111 1 115 10 the end, has undergone least
manipulation and most faithfully represents 1110 original authority 3
and it is precisely here that we find the largest amount 01 Stolo
matter. Again, noticing the remarkable break after 1 105, where
(110010 after propoaing to consider 1110 question 01 the abode and
manner 01 life 01 the gods in 1 103, suddenly recurs tc their nature,
leaving 1110 previous question altogether unanswered‚ he suggests
that we have here a fragment 01 the original, which 0. began to
translate, but found to be unsuited to his purpose of mectlng the
speech of Velleius and forgot afterwards to cancel. Here again there
are marked indicatione 01 a Stoic origin, as I have pointed out in
my notes on the bestiae 1110019110 nasci 1101011101, and on 11010100
accornmodotum.

There are however some arguments which need consideration in
favour of the Academia origin of the section. Thus Hirzel has
pointed out the close resemblance between parts of this and tha
sceptical argument in Sext. Emp. 111 also the inconsistency between
Gottu's statement as 1ο the superstition of Epicurus 5 85, and that
which is quoted from Posidonius in §1233 and lustly the anti-Stoic
sentimenta which we find interspersed, 0. g. the repeated profession
of agnosticism 157, 66, 84, 91, 94, the contempt for the 0010011101

9011110015 62, the objection 10 the rationalizing aud allegoriaing of
the myths§ 119. Schwenke replies with considerable force that

Sextus has himself horrowed from a Stcio original in such passages
as 1x 123 and 131; that we find the opposing views as to the
sincerity of Epicurus' religione belief stated 111 Sext. Emp. 11 ta and
