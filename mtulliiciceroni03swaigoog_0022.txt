the Stoica in a later page, and that Cicero wrote in too great a hurry
either to soresee this, or to correct what he had already written. ,
Perhaps this is going too iar. It is plain that Cicero felt the necas· ἒ

sity for compressing very much the historical reriew, and a simple i

means of doing this was to omit repetitions He was also about to
speak of Prodicus in Gotta's reply (N. D. r 118), and he alludes to
Heraclitus as the forerunner oi the Stoice in 111 35, atating that, as
he chose to be unintelligible, it was useless to discuss his opinions

Safar there appears to be no improbability iu Cicero's having r

bestowed direotly from Philodemus, but it becomes mora difficult to
suppose this, when we compare the two writings more minutely. j
Thus, while both criticize Anaximenes, Ph. has nothing in common
with O„ but merely speaks of air as without sensation 3 while there
is a fair agreement as to the doctrines oi Anaxagoras, thera iano
criticism in Ph.; on Pythagoras and Democritus Ph. is too hag· l
mentary to allow of comparison 3 on Parmenides thare is hardly any

agreement; on Diogenes they ageres to a certain extent, but Ph. is r
much fuller, on Xenophon Ph. quotes correctly, as iar as the hag- κ
ment is legible, but gives no criticism, while 0. is wrong throughout ς Ῐ
on Antisthenes they agree, but Ph. has no criticism; on Aristotle ’

there is nothing legible in Ph. beyond the actual reference 3 on Theo-
phrastus Ph. has merely a reference to a treatise not mentioned by
O.; on Persaeus there is substantial agreement, but Ph. is much

fuller, he does not however give anything of the criticism we find in ,
G.; between Theophrastus and Persaeusc. has some ³2 lines on ·

Strato, Zeno, and Cleanthes, to which there was probably something
corresponding in pp. 73-75 of Ph, where we can traca broken
allusions to the universal reason and the power that holds all things
together, but the names are lost 3 while there is general agreement
on Chrysippus (see my n. on N. D. r 39), Ph. is much fuller, except

where O. dilates on the Stoicidae of the Divina Iaw; so on Diogenes ·

oi Babylon.

This slight shetoh will show that, if 0. has horrowed irom Ph be
has used him with the utmost freedom, omitting without somple,
and, if we may weigh tha evidence oi the fragments according to the
ordinary law of chances, one would say, adding not unfrequently

from other sources. It is true that the absence oi criticism atter ’
each name in Philodemus, may be explained by the fact that he ’
reservas it all ior the end (pp. 84-89). But then when we examine ³

this later criticism, we find nothing in common between it and that
