eam esee omem-eumenus Madv. thinks that thir clause was
sdded by e resder who misunderstood the construction mecm ei (l) end it
has accordingly been bracketed by later editors The objections es stated
by Sole Opust. m 317 foll. are (l) that it is superfluous in sense, we had
already been told that man's sels-sdmiration was one cf the grounds cf
anthropomorphism ; (2) that in reading the sentence, we naturally taire si as
depending cn minem, and it causes an awkward surprise when we find that
it is intended for the protasis ol the sentenoe; (3) thet the sequence of
tenses is violated by peteremus atter eree. Kl. (Adra erit. 111 7> defends
the ress reading, andI am inclined to think heis right The clause may
be superfluous in reference to what precedes, hut iiwe look to the follow·
ing sentence, we shall see that it is needed in order to explain the iutro
duction oi ei ratic esea. Cicero is secking to prove thet the reason why
mun attributes his own form to the gods whom he worships, is because
he, in common with other animals, loves his own form best 3 end he pro·
oeeds to argue that this common incidentes animal nature would, if soted

· upon by reason, lead the other animale each tc glorify (plurimum tribn-
εοεαε) his own nature in like manner, ci. the passage from Xenophanes
quoted below. Ii there is any corruption in the tert, one might suggest
the loss of a sentence referring to the 3rd reason ior anthropomorphism
(domtdtmw modi). At present this is mesori orer without notice, and
0.· returns to the iirst reason in ξς 81-85, only introducing the 3rd in
§87 mixed up there with another argument from experiente. ds to the
2nd objection, there is no doubt a slight awkwardness in separating ei
from mirum, hut this is certainly not a fatal objeotion to the correctness ol
the sentence. Or it might be possible to take ei as depending on mirum,
and then to suppose the construction brolren, eam eree caueam being in-
troduced es a sort of epexegetic clause, also dependent on mimae Such
a change ol construction might be compared with that aiter· facit ξ 31

to praeeminet, as in Lael. 2 miniati...quonto est proreta, where the
tense is attracted to an intermediate Imperi, see Dreeg. ξ 151 t o, end
