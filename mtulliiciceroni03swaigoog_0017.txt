tained in the first 11001101 the N. D. I will begin with giving a
short account 01 this treatise, proceeding then 10 point out 1110 more
striking resemblanoes between it and 1110 present work, and will
finally examine more in detail the relations 01 the two to each other.

In the year 1152 great curiosity was excited by the discovery 01
a library at Herculaneum in the house which has been called 01101
Ρ110 the father-in-law 01 Caesar', from 11101101 that ‘its site agrees
with Cicero’s statement that 1110 residence 01 the Pisas was visible
110111 his own 11111 at Puteoli' (Hayter's Report on aa Herordaneum
MSS, London 1811, p. 31); and also 110111 the fact that most 01 the
1100 found there contained treatises by writers belonging 10 the
Epicurean school, 01 which Piso was an adherent, and that many 01
them bore the 111111οο1 Philodemus, who is known (from Cicero’s
speech ia Pisonem) to have been the intimate friend and instructor
01 Piso. The difficulty of unrolling the charrod papyri 1110 very
great, and it was not till the year 1793 that the lat Vol. 01
Hercrdoaensia (containing the treatise of Philodemus περὶ μουσικῆς)
appeared at Naplea At the instigation 01 the English Ambassador,
Sir W. Hammon, the Princo 01 Wales undertook to supply the
necessary funda 101 carrying on 1110 work more actively‚ and also
sent his librarian, the Rev. J ohn Hayter, to assist 111 opening and
copying the uss; in which he sucoeeded so well that, in the four
years from 1802 10 1806, more than 200 were enrolled. In the
latter year the work had 10 be abandoned in consequence 011110
French occupationes Naples, but copies 0194 uss, 11101 remaining
1011 while 11 Palermo, were ultimately sent 10 England and pre
sented 10 the Bodleian together with 10111 unopened papyri¹3 and in

maintains that two 01 tho busta found there represent Piso and his colleague
Gabinius ; and certainly they agree remarkahly well with Cicero’s description 01
the pair in his speech Pro Sext. la
