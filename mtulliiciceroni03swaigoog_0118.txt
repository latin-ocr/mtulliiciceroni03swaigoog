existent, incorporeal mirid ¹, whereas Epicurus of oourse preferred the other
alternative and pmclaimed the priority of matter. But the form given to
the doctrine oi Thales in the preceding sentence would not be inconsistent
with a pure idealism; indeed Minucius o. 19, quoting this passage says
that T. copied the Moesia account of the Spirit of (lod moving upon the
face of the wetere. We may therefore conclude that this form is due ιο
0. himself, und that the author whom he follows could have said nothing of

‘mind making all things out of water' ; but only described in general terme ι

the combination of two principles The use of the plmal cli after the sing.
deus may be intended to heighten the supposed absurdity of the dogma, or
it may be au allusion to tho words alrealy quoted mirra πλήρη θεῶν.

Another way of dealing with the sentence is te regard ri inec-tempore as ⁸

an example of repeated protasis: so Heiud, Moser, Krische, K'uhner. As
the repetition of the protasis would be only admissible here, if the tud

protasis were really a reetatemeut of the ist, (see lladv. Fir. 1 7, who calls -

this passage grauiter wdone) we should then have to take mm as ex·
plaining di, and riae corpore as explaining riae ecura, interpreting as fol·
lows, ‘if the gods, ie. pure mind, can exist spart from feeling, ie. hom a
humen body (we must take corpus thus if it is essential to sensatico, for
body in the wide sense, including the elementa, is eiua κνοω· see below on

Empedocles and Diogenes) why did he add mind to waterl¹ But it is plain Ἴ

that there ie no logical connexion here between protasis and apodosia
Nor is anything gained by reading motu for mem with Moser, Krische,
Kiihner. Kr. defends the change by areferenee to the polemio agrdnst

‘Auamgoras just below, and to a passage in Philodemus p. 881 ³0, where '
