et deus: Mr Roby proposes to read αι (which might easily lose its
vowel ester οαιιιοια, and change inlaet) as it introduces a minor premiss in
a quasi-syllogistic argument But where oue syllogism is subordinated to
another (as in this passage οἰιιοι aalma-epita represents the minor
premiss in the syllogism oi which siae cirrata asilo arada is the major, and
ne beatu quidem the conclusion) it is not uncommon to omit the signs ol
opposition between the propositione oi the subordinate syllogIsm : thus,
A, none are happy without virtue; B, but virtue is active and your God
inactiva, therefore not virtuous; (l, therefore your god is not happy.

ne sacua andem: ‘not happy either' (wanting in happiness as well
as in virtue), ci. ξ 72 n., and ξ 113.
