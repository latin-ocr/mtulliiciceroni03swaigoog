eccur in the mutilated title ef the Philodemian treatise numbered
1389. This 10 01 importance 10 regcrd te the question whether the
resemblances between (licere and Philodemus are to be explained by
direct copying en the part of the former, er whether beth writers
may not have· berrewed from Zeno.

Iproceed new te point eut what is the nature ef these resem-
blances, and I think it will be seen that they 00000110 simply set
asida hy such remarks as Sch'emann's (Introd. p. 18) ‘thuliche
Angaben und Urtheile, wie dort, kamen ohne allen Zweifel in gar
munchen anderen epikureischen Schriften ebenfalls von’ (1000001
arguments no doubt might be a part ef the commen Epicurean tradi-
tion, but it 10 mest improbable that this should be the ease with
rogaui te minute points ef criticism and to particular citatione
from the writings 01 opponente, seme 01 them misinterpreted, and
likely therefore to have been exposed by hostile criticism, 11 they
were in common use. Such references are these te Xenophen’s Ἀπο
μνημονεύματα (Phil. p. 71, N. D. 31) 3 10 the Φυσικός of Antisthenes
(Phil. p. 72, N. D. 32), in support 01 0 proposition ef which we have
ne informatien frern ether sources; to the ere beek 01 Aristetle's
περὶ φιλοσοφίας (Phil. p. 72 3 N. D. 33); te Chrysippus περὶ θεῶν
bk 1 (Phil. p. 77, N. D. 41), treating 01 the Steic theolegy in general,
bk 11 (Phil p. 80, N. D. 41) containing his explanationes the mytho
legy ef Orpheus, Musaeus, Homer and Hesiod3 10 the περὶ τῆς
Ἀθηνᾶς 01 Diogenes 01 Babylon (Phil. p. 82, N. D. 41).

Assuming then, as we may, that there is an undoubted nemesion
between the two treatises, the next point is to determine its nature and
extent. If we compare them broadly together, we find the Epicurean
argument in the lst book 01 the N. D. made up 01 three parts, (l)
a preliminary polemio against the Platonic and Stoie views 01 the

origin 01 the world and the nature 01 Ged (ἐξ 18-24); (2) a critical ¹

review 01 earlier philosophers from Thales te Diogenes 01 Babylon,

followed by a brief notice ef the popular mythology 10 Graece ἵ

and elsewhere (ἐξ 25-43) ; (3) an exposition 01 the Epicurean thee-
legy. Similarly the Philodemian treatise, as we have it, is made up
ef three parts (l) a criticism 01 the popular mythology (pp 5-61);
(2) a criticism ef elder philosophers (pp. tte-89), (3) an exposition
ef the Epicurean theolegy (pp. 93-151). The resemblanees netieed
above belong te the second, er hister-ical sectien, which we will
new examine more closely. Cicere’s list 01 philosophers is as fel-
