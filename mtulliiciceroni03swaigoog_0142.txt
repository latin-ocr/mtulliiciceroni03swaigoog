§ 37 Aristo: of Chios (Krische 404-413) represents a (lycio reac-
ticn in the Stoic school ; he conlined himself exclusively to ethim on the ¹

ground that logic was a spider’s wsb, curicus but uselem, and that physica
vvere beyond our incultios : Stob. Παντὶ. 80, ’1 πρὸς ἡμᾶς μὲν εἶναι τὰ ἠθικά, ¹

μὴ πρὸς ἡμᾶς rd διαλεκτικά· μὴ γὰρ συμβᾶλλεσδαι πρὸς denhem βίον· ὑπὲρ
ἡμᾶς dd vd φυσικά· ἀδύνατα ylp ἐγνῶσθαι καὶ ccidi παρέχειν χρείαν. It is
therefore probably correct, though vve have no actual confirmation hom
other sources, that ho denied the possibility of our knowing anything about
ocu The particular form given 1ο the denial is of course due to the
Epicurean reporter.

cleanthes: Krische 415-436. He is referred tc N. D. 11 13, 111 16
(the four grounds oi religious belief) 11 24 and 40 (all-pervading hest) 11 63,
11163 (allegorical interpretation). Cleanthes is more distinguished ior
moral strength and religione earnestness than ior any speculative advanoe t
nono of the doctrines here mentioned are peculiar to him: one in lact is
wrongly ascribed to him. While holding with the rest olbis school that
the universe was divine in virtue oi the aetherial soul by which it vvas
animated, he placed tho source and seat oi aether in the sun, and not as
tho others (agreeing with Aristotle) in the fiuthest heaven, cf. Aa 11126
