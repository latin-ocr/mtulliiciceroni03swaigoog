eoos 1 cu. xu §30. 117

the lst (us) sentence and the variety of positive assertions as ιο the Deity
in the ard (ars) sentence, is much more glaring than the opposition
between the lst sentence and the one negative assertion os the ind
sentence. Besides the idea cf inconsistency runs through the 3rd sen-
tence, whereas it is entirely absent in the tad. 1 think also that the
repetition of et is intended to point the contre-st, ‘aster having spoken as
he did in the Timaeus and Laws, we find him in eoa asserting not only
that we can name God, but that there are any number of srrbstances which
we may call by that name'. Taking it then es certain that the opposition
lies between the letand the 3rd sentencesl have little doubt that the ind
and 3rd have got misplaced. Compare the transposition in §5 of the
sentences beginning qua qreiclem and multam αιιιοηι, that in § 88 and
ξ 97, and many similar instances in Munro's Lucretius, see his Intro·
duction p. 20 foll. ed. l, also Mllller in N. Jaart. for 1864, p. 141„ In the
present ease and else in ξ 5 the transposition may be explained by sup-
posing the misplaced clauses (Sciat cero and Qua quidem) to have been
added on revision by C. himself, but wrongly inserted by the scribe. See
below on idern in Timaeo.

inconstantia: Grote (Plato 11 161) applies this censure more generally.
The discrepaney between different dialogues is partly to be accounted for
by the change in Platc's own sentimenta during the course ef a long lile,
partly by the different aim and style of the particular dialogues, scientifie,
popular, allegorical
