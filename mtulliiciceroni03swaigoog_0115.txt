φυλάττειν edroi δυνάμενον τὴν μετὰ ἀφθαρσίας peroptima trapi αὖτὸν

absurdities: aa we read in Philodemus¹ p. 96 ‘the Epicuream condemn all
who differ from them cir dr ὑπεναντία τῇ προλῆψει ὁογμοτιζόνταν’. Further
there is no attempt at accuracy in giving the opinions of the earlier
philosophem: rather they ere intentionally caricatured in order to make

. them more open to attach. C. in fact has put into the mouth of Vell a
speech suitable ιο his own description of the Epicurean mods of con· v

How far the inaccuraoies of the speech ατο ιο be attributed to O. himself
or to his Epicurean authorities is discumed in the Introduction Minucius
(ο. 19) gives α summary of this section to prove an opposite conclusion, vir.

Orelli’s uss, this is in the first place hardly α suitable term for what

the fact that a large part of the subsequent polemio is directed against
the Stoica 1 am inclined therefore to retain the old reading, translating
‘Such is a general statement of the Stoic doctrines: I will now praeced
to show how they are related to the older philosophies'; more literally
‘to show what their character is, 1 will truce baok their history to its
earliest source’. Probably there may have been some Stoic history of
philosophy professing to show that their doctrines were substantially the
saum as those held by the most esteemed of the earlier philosophare The
Epicureans would meet this by endeavouring ιο prove that such support
could only damage their cause. Fertsch (aaut hott 1837) explains it
