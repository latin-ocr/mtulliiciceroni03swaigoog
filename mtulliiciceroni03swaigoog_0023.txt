in 0.,11 will bc seen from the following summary 01 Ph's remarks.
‘The Stoica in general are far more opposed to the established
religion than we Epicuream, ii they grant the existence of a deity,
which they do not all do, they at any rate aeknowledge no more than
one God, while they impcse 011 tha multitude with their names and
allegorias. 'l'hey are worse atheists, with their etheis and elementa,
than Diagoras, who conieoeed the existence and power 01 the Gods
By asserting that God 0001101110 the author 01 evil they do away
with religione sanctione, which we retain ς they call the Gods mortal,
· we essert their eternity. Even it they allowed punishment in word,
who could sear these senscless elementsl None would regard Gods
incapable 01 motion 0101 sense 3 or pay any heed to the moral tench-
ing 01 those who are in doubt whether there are Gods or what is
their nature, or who plainly deny them: men might ewen be encou-
raged to sin by those who speak 01 endless striis among the Gods
Thus the philosophare are reducing men to the state of brutas, for
they remove the oheck of religion and also 01 public opinion, which
are the best helps ior restraining injustica' It is plain that there
is moia cf 0011001 thought and 01 a real interest in religion and
morality here, thau there is in the flippant mrcasms put into the
mouth of Velleius

We go on to the other sections of Philodemus The first, dealing
with the popular mythology, is made by 0. a mere appendix to the
section we have just been considering3 and while it occupies some
60 pp in Ph it is condensed into a dozen lines by 0. It will be seen
from my nn. 011 ffi 42, 43 that most 01 the points touched by Ο. arc
fully treated by Ph, but there is no allusion to the Magiaus in the
extant fragments oi the latter. In the 3rd sectiou, as far as we can
judge from broken phrases (see 11.011 5 49 docet eum esse vinc), Ph.
seems to have treated 01 the divine nature in a manner not unlike (1.1
he speaks 01 the Gods es free from anger and favour and absolutely
perfect and blessed, and he is equally strong against superstitious
fears3 buthe makes religion a much more practica] thing (see the

passages quoted 011 5 44 qaod 1100111111 essct). Thus ‘piety is productiva
of innocence and harmiessness (p 95) 3 byinnocence man may imitate
the blessedness 01 the Gods (p. 148); Epicurus honoured his parents,
loved his brothers, obscrved all religione dutiae (p. 118), and charged
his disciples todothe 0111110111 obedience to the lawe (p 126), bnt
