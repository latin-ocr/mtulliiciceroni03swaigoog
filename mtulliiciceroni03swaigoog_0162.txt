virtue of a coutinuous stream oi images combining to produce in usthe
impression oi a human form Such a description suits fairly with the
account given of Democritus' theology (N. D. 1 120) according to which the
(lods are nothing more than combinatione ol ethereal atoma floating about
as imaqiam but it is difficult to see how it could be reconciled with
the ordinary account of Epicurus’ innumerable Gods oi the immuadia,
far removed from the sphere of those atomio storms which are ever making
and unmaking the alhmunding worlda Ii the imagines which appear 2ο men
are composed of atoma thmwn off hom the (lods oi the iatermaadt'a, why
may not atoms find their way back again from our world 2ο them, as in
lact is asserted by Cotta§ 1141 How can beings which have no solidatae
be continually throwing off those myriads oi atoms oi which the images
are formed, especially when we consider the vast disteme of the irater·
rnaadia from the earth, and reflect that, radiation being equal in all
directions, there must be the same crowding of divine images at every
point of this immense circumferencel Again, ifthe Gods have no separate
individuality, how are they capable ol conversing together aud exhibiting
au ideal of the philosophie life, as Philodemus assertedl And how are
euch Gods in any degree truer to the popular conception than the ἀέρος καὶ
πνεύματα which Philodemus charges the Stoice with worshipping (p. 84
foll.)l See hlunro on Lucr. v 152 Assuming then, aswe apparently may,
that either Epicurus himself or some of his followers aclrnowledged a divinity
of a more spiritual type, distinct imm those of the immunda, there is
much in the description which ia curicusly suggestive of a theology with
which we are familiar in the present day. When people understand by the
name (lod ‘a stream of tendency which makes ior righteousness', or in
other words, a predominating character in the events ol life and the
phenornena oi the universe which answers 2ο and calls out in us an ideal
oi goodness (and why not also which answers 2ο and calls out our ideals of
beauty aud oi wisdom l) they do not at first ascribe to (lod personality οι·
numerical identity, but as they meditate on the impressione which they
receive, they become gradually oonscious of a unity, shaping itseli, ior some
et least, ἀνθρωποειδεῖς, into a human form, in which they recognize the
features of the judge, the mler, the father. Some such idealistic interpre-
tation cf the physical formularies of his school was certainly not more
‹lifficult to a religione Epicurean than the spintualization of the myths was
to a Stolo, and however far removed from ordinary Epicurean belief, it is
not altogether inconsistent with some of the citatione from Philodemus
given under qaod beatam ξ 45.

ξ 50. summa vis infinitatis: suggested by the use ol infinita just
before. On the way in which Ep. connected the idea of infinity with the dis-
tribution of life, see Lucr. 11 522 foll, where he argues that the deficiency
of animale, ag. elephanta, in one country is made up ior by their excess
in another, and that for the generation oi any particular kind of animal it
was necessary that there should have been en iulinity of the atoms which
