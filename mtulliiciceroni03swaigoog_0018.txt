the year 1810 a volume of Herculanensis, editcd by Drummond and
Walpole, was published in London. This contained an anonymous
fragment, twelve columns in length, entitled by the editors περὶ τῶν
θεῶν. The fragment excited considerable interest owing 10 1100 0000000-
10100000 11 presented to parts 01 1100 speech of Velleius in the first
book 01 1100 N. D, and it was ably reviewed in the 1100010010ι and
Edinbnrglt during the course of the year. Hayter wrote a reply
10 1100 former in thesaure year, speaking 01 1100 book as Φαίδρου περὶ
θεῶν. The same authorsbip had been already claimed ferit by Mtirr,
in a German translation of Philodemus περὶ μουσικῆς (Berlin, 1806),
in which he announced 11001 among the forthcoming Herculaneum
publicatione there was a treatise entitled Φαίδρου περὶ φύσεως θεῶν,
which had been made use 01 by 010000 100 1010 own work on the
seme subject Heyter allows that the name Philodemus would
naturally suggest itself, buthe says the space does not admit 01
reading 00 many letters. An improved text with notes was brought
out in 1833 by Peterson 01 Hamburg, under the title Phaedri
Epimrei, 00100 anonymi Paratianensis, dc Natura Deorum He
uses the following arguments to show that Phaedrus must be 1100
author. 810000 0100000 chief instructore in the doctrines of Epicurus l
were Zeno and Phaedrus, both of whom 000 prominently mentioned 1
in the N. D, it 10 natural 10 suppose that ha must have horrowed =
from one or the other. And as Phaedrus 10 spoken of in terma 01

Zeno (ὅ 94) 10 said to bave attackcd his own contemporaries, whereas
the lateat writer criticized in the speech 01 Velleius is Diogenes of
Babylon, who died not later than 150 sc. The strongest argument
however in favour of Phaedrus is, that in a 10110010 Atticus (0000 43),
written about the time 01 1100 composition 01 the N. D, 010000 aska
