we mest with in the Philodemian fragment is Pythagoras p. 66, 606
there are clear allusione to Anaximenes (l) in p. 65, to Anaxagoras

no reference to Alcmaeon or Xenophanes, but efter Pythagorae (3)
follows Parmenides (4) 10 p. 67, then Democritus (5) p. 6011000071-

Cleanthes (16) isincideutally alluded to in p. 80, and Zeno (17) 10
p. 84.

considering the very fragmentary state 01 660 Philodemien trea-
tise from p. 65 60 75 (1.0. 6111 we resch Persaeus), it is remarkable
that more than hali 01 Cicero's list should be found in 16 almost
iu 660 same oider' , 6606 10 6066 Aristippus should beomitted; lastly
that both should end with Diogenes, making no mention 01 610 suc·
sessore Antipater and Panaetius, the latter 01 whom exercised 0 100
greater influence over the Romanis then any other Stoic'. It appears
strange however that Heraclitus and Prodicus are not included in
ticero's list Hirzel thinks thie 10 because Philodemus identifies the
teaching of Persaeus with thet 01 Prodicus p. 76, and the teaching of
Heraclitus with that 01 Chrysippus p. 81, 60 which Schwenke objects

thet Philod. gives the doctrines of Prodicus and Heraclitus by them·
selvae in the first instance, and only mentions their agreement with
