other philosophers have dissembled their views aa to the immorality y
oi parts of the popular religion, Epicurus laid down the plain rule

that we must conform except where impiety is commanded (p. 120);
God is friendly to the good, estranged from tho bad (124), if Epi·

cirrus had been a hypocrite he would never have taken suoh psius in .
writing on the subject of religion (p. 134)’. Hirzel p. 15s011. calls ,

attention to the fact that certain points ag. the ἰσονομία and the

quusi corpses mentioned by O. are not referred to Epicurus by Diog. L. g

and may probably be considered later developments of Epicurean

doctrine. ·
There is still the first section of Cicero ιο consider, which has

nothing corresponding to it in the fragments of Philodemus It is a

preliminary criticism oi the Plutonia and Stoic theorias of tho origin ³
of the world, turning chiefly on the difficulties involved in the idea *J

of oreation at any given moment The argument is similar ιο that
contained in Lnor. v. 110-234,andP1ut. Pl. Phil. p. 881, but given

more fully thanx in either. We find no allusion ιο it in the following
sections of the N. D. To this is joined an argument (repeated in

the later sections) against s mundans deity, as inconsistent with the ἵ

divine attributes oi rationality and blessednesa Such a preliminary
criticism comes naturally enough to prepare the way for the positive
statements of the Epicurean theology, as there was no body of
belief which could be upheld against the latter, except such as was
derived either from Plato or the Stoica.

When we try to determine the connexion between this and the
historical section which follows, there is much to suggest the oon·
clusion of Krische (p. 23) and Hirzel, that the latter section was
inserted as an afterthought Thus in ς 36 we find ut jam ud vestros
Balbe amiam, though the Stoica, whom Balbus represents, had been
already treated oi in the earlier section3 similarly in regard to

Plato (5 30 compared with5 18); and the inconsistenoy is still more ι
manifest in ᾗ 25, if we insert alio with most editors, reading tao ,

quidem υωινα, patalia vero alio sint ab ultimo repetam (see my notes
ou these passagoe). Itis further objected that there are no subse-
qnent allusione to the historical section either by Cotta or Belbus;

but Cotta does allude to it three times, ἓξ 63, 91, 94, and, even ii he
had not done so, there would be nothing surprising in it, since Cicero,

as Schwencks remarks p. 56, is not likely to have had sny Greek
treatise at haud in which the historical errore of the Epicureans wore
pointed out, and there was no occasion for Balbus to recur to an ¹
