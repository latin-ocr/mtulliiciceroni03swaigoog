the universe considered apart from mind, though when the unintelligible
mom infanda had been changed into the abstract infinitior, it could not
fail to suggest to an Epicurean the thought 01 the infinite void as its only
legitimate interpretation To Anaxagorae the infinity 01 mind meant its
unlimited wisdom and power: here it is understood of a mind not bounded
in space or inclosed in body, but the Epicureans recognired no immaterial
existence except τὸ κενόν, which cen neither 011001 001· be affected but

translated by Ktlhner ‘a sensation which the nature of the infinito
mind would experience without being itself moved by it ², governing qao
by patra Sela makes tratura palso Abl Abs (rightly, as I think) and
gcverns qao by sentiret: he proposes also to substitute 100100 lor abac
'l'he meaning then would be ‘a feeling with which it would leel without
its own nature being moved’. Heind. inserts tota from the quotation in

the awkward construction qao (anea) reuirat, aad his explanation seems to
make the Epicureans attribute feeling to inanimato nature, 0 conception as
