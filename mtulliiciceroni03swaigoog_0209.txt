suit the context What is wanted is a phrase to cxprcm strict logical
procedure ns opposed to o mere statement oi beliot, and I think this
is better expressed by the Abl than by Sch’s argumenta (or maumam)
mutuo, see his opusc 111 289 and 328. Mndr„ it istrue, denies the
possibilityotthisrceding, sce hisnoteon dia 1 tolutim ‘culicum crpu-
mumonuuum’ dicimur, etiam ‘aliquid corucludcrc' ut aumatium pro-

own lsnguage, and the correctneae of the expression is, I thinlr, shown by
the citatione in hitiller Adue Or. r, eg. Ac132ttaquc tradebatur omum dico
tectim decerptum, id cet, eruunt rutrum emulusac, which Reid translates
‘speech drown up in syllogistic form’; ci too Dio. 1 82 quom (diviua-
