some euch clause as melacium auton eet ia nomo corpore nimio affici out
calore aret frigora He would therefore omit quodque—stiam dei alto-
gether, considering the first part a gloss on the preceding sentence, and
tbe latter pert a glosa tc give precision ιο the argument of the following
gemtem mucidi partes eum (it would also be necessary to change the
following utqui into atqve). I see no objection tc the former clause, if
we accept Lachmann's emendation sic incitetur ‘if it is carried along so

fast’ instead of the ns reading riprefflcetur, which there is no authority ‘¹'

for interpreting (with Wyttenbach iu loc and Beier Off. 146) to mean ‘if
there were the slightest hint (saintest truce) of it’. Sch’s emendation
(Opim. 111 184, 303) οἱο officialia only adds an obscurer cic ιο the obscure
quod. Another objecticn tatheus reading might be that minim ec
parte, though true enough if we imagine our body hurried along by itself
with the velocity then attributed ιο the sphere οἰ the tired stare, would

be absurd exaggeration if spoken with reference ιο cnr power oi enduring
tropical heat or arctio cold; but we must remember that the ancient-s,

changed, not because the speaker disclaims responsibility ior the statement,
