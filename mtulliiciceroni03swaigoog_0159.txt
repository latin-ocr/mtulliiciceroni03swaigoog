Whately’s topic App. (on the ambiguity cf the word ‘same‘). But will κατ’
ἀριθμόν osny this meaning by itselil For proci oi this Hir-nel refers ta
Bonits’s Iader Aristotelicas 1 v. ἀριθμός, see particularly Anat 11111111,
p. 74 where the phrase κατ’ ἀριθμόν is used 11 argument which applies only
to a single individual trianglc, es opposed to proper geometrical reasoning
which deols with the triangle, qua triangle, universally. Similarly we have
κατ’ ὅριθμόν ὑφεστῶτας in 1111111111 already quoted from Diog. Is. It
is impossible howeverto suppose that ad numerata standing alone could
convey this meaning to 1 Roman ; and though it is conceivable that G.
may hare put an unmeaning phrase into the mouth 11 the Epicurean advo-
cate, it seems hardly credible that he should, without remark, have
supplied the interpretation afterwards through the mouth 11 the Academia
critic I believe therefore that 111111 has beenlost between sapa and ad,
and that the true readingis aeqao wdem ad assurum 111. Ipostpone ta
the end 11 the paragraph the question, how we are to conceive 11 Gods not

it is not perceived by sense or by mind, nor in consequence ol any sort 11
solidity which it possessas, nor numerically, ia individually’l A 111111
abl gives indirectly what is wanted, a description 11 the object which
