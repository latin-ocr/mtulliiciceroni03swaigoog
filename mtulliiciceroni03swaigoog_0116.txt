Thales& The statement here made as to the two principles assumed
by T. is opposed tc all themora ancient authorities Thus Aristotle
(Metapa Α. 3) makes him the leader 01 those who started from one
material principle, and contrasts Anaxagoras with all his predecessore
as having first felt the need of a separate intelligent principle. lt is true
that by water T. understood something more than mere lifeless matter
moved by mechanioal causes, like the atoma 01 Democritus. Water was
a living substance endued with a θεία δύναμις κινητική (Stob. Ed. 156) s,
whence Aristotle says (cie Aa 1 b 17) acl ἐν τῷ ὅλῳ τινὲς ψυχὴν μεμῖχθαί
φασιν, ὅθεν icus rui θολῆι ᾠήθη πάντα πλήρη θεῶν εἶναι, to which C. alludee
Lep. 11 263 but the system was a pure ‘hylozoiem’. It was therefore by a
mere misunderstanding that later compilare erich as Stobaeus, la and ’
Plutarch Piae. Phil. 1 7 p. 881 ιι, attributed to T, who left no writings be-
hind him, (Diog. L. 1 23) the statement that (lod was the soal 01 the world.

C. here departs even further from the truth in hie phrase qaae ac aqua ·

cancta fingeret, implying a distinct creation out 01 inert matter by some
arternal force. Elsewhere he gives the usual account, Aa 11 118 Thalea ea·

aqua dreit ceinture munia [hir Reid would get rid 01 the inconsistcncy in i

(t's account of nh. by inserting et between cem and meuen‘that water was
the first principle, and that it (water) was God and the mind which pro-

duced all things out 01 water ². One would be glad 1ο relieve O. from the ,

charge of talking nonsense, but it is a question here whether he would ’
object to put nonsanse into the mouth of Vell, and it must be remembered
that we have tbe evidence of Minucius in favour of the existing reading]

cur aquae οιϋιιιιιοίι, si ipae mern dic, reema with difficulties To what does
di alludel According to the preceding sentence T. only attributed divinity
to mind, aud here we have just the opposite supposition 01 deities with·
out mind: then we find a transitive verb without an object, and lastly
another supposition as iotha possibility of mind existing spart from body,
this supposition standing alone as a protasis without an epodosis lf, set
ting aeide the grammatical difficulties, we endeavour to establish a gohard
connexion in thought with what precedes, we have to consider whether tho
argument is direct, or ad laminam, whether corpote is used in its wider
sense (= matter), cr its narrower (ει animated body), lastly how we are to
understand the words dena audoenem. It will help to clear the ground if
I first give Epicurus’ own account 01 00010011οι1 (Diog. L. 1163) καὶμὴν
