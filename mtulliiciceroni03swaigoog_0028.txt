though he expressed his own assent to the latter 3 that (t's motivo
for maintaining the other view in 5 85 was probably the wish to give
bis own experieuce on the subject 3 lastly thot the sntiStoic remarks

sometimes in purely Stoic passages 3 thet in general the Stoic writers
form the storo-house from which (l. borrows his arguments aguinst
Epicurus, whilst he attacks the Stoice themselves with weapons
sorged by the Academy, as in the De 89116111,- that in the present
trectise this is loreshadowed by the longuoge used of the Epicurean
doctrines in 5 3, of the Stoic in 5 4 3 that Euhemerism is nottho same

as in 555, 30 aud 97 3 and on emendations of words, asin ᾗ 26,
49, 71. In the critical notes my object has been to put the render
