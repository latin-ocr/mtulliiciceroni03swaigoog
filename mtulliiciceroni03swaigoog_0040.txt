somewhst bold for us in the nineteenth century ιο commeuce a
reform od the alphabet which Cicero used, but in the first place
we do not comrncme the reform, we merely keep the spelling
which the common sense of preceding centurias has handed down
to us; and in the next place we know from Quintilian 1 4 5 ll,
that Cicero himself felt the need of distinctiva marks for the con·
sonantal and the vowel 1, and that it was his practice ιο double
the Ι in writing such a word as Ajua 'lhough this symbol did not
psas into general use, yet it was felt by others that some sort οιΙ
distinctiva mark was needed, aud stall I was occadonally employed
in the imperial times ιο denote the consonantal sound oi Ι. Ii the
intervening generations have provided us witha more convenient
character, 1 do not see why we are to throw away this advantage,

any more than we do those of punctuation or of the discriminating
types, which were equally unknown to the Romans. Ι may ιο

allowed by the way to express my regnet that Baiter, in common
with many German editors, has ceased ιο mark the beginning of
the sentence by a capital letter, thus making it more difficult
to glauce rapidly over a page and catch the general sense. What
was the motiva ior this beyond a mere love oi change in trivial
details Ι am unable ιο conjecture.

If I may hope that my use oi the letter J, as above explained,
may be conceded, aa at womt a venial error, Ι tear that the par-
ticular use οι it, which I am about to confess, can only be viewed
in the light oi a mortal sin by philologists of the modern school.
Ι refer ιο my retention'oi the oldsashioned spelling os the compounds
oi jocio, corcy'ido rejicio disjicio sor conicio reicio (liuticio. As there
em be no doubt that the latter was the usual spelling oi the
Quintilian age, how smI to defend the iniringement oi the rule,
which Ihavs myself laid down abovel My answer is that rules
must gIvs way to principles, and the principle of good spelling
is that it should represent correctly the etymology and the pronuncia·
tion oi the word, neither of which is done by ιιο spellings in ques-
tion Another inconveniencs arising from the omission of ιιο J is
that the lawa ol prosody will thus be broken in almost all the cases
in which the compounds ol 1μιοιο appear in latin verse In urging
these objections l do no more than repeat what was said by the
ancients themselves Gellius has a chapter on this very subject
(N. A. lv 17) in which he finds fault with the omission oi the
consonantal i in tho compounds of jacio, aa coniusing versification
