parocheroJOno ot his most famous speeohes was that in deience of
his uncle Rutilius alluded to in N.D. 111 80.

To allow of Cotta’s being pontifex and not consul, the time of
>he Dialogus must be laid between 82 and 75 n.0.; and as Cicero
was studying at Athens in 79 and 78 and did not return to Rome
till 77 ao„ we narrow the possible limits to the interval between
77 and 75, when Cicero was about 30 years of ago and Ootta
orbant 48.

Little is known of 0. Velleius, the spokesman oi the Epicureans,
beyond tho fact that he was born at Lanuvium (uo. 182), was a
friend of the orator Crassus (see note on158) and held the office of
Tribune in the year 90 no, He is called radia dwetidi (Or. 111 78),
and is described as holding the first placo among the Romans oi his
sect (MD. 1 15). In the De Finibus L Manlius Torquatus is the
Epicurean disputurt

Of Q. Lucilius Balbus, the spokesmau of tho Stoice, we know
even less. Iu tho Digest 1 21. 2 §41 it is stated that he studied
under the pontifex Scaevda. He was the instructor cf Sulpicius
(Boset. 42, Dig. 121. 2543). See Brut. 154. He was an inter-
locutor iu the lost dialogue entitled Hortensius and is praised as not
inferior to the most distinguished Stolos oi Graece. In tho De
Fiailm tho Stolos oro represented by Octo, in tho De Divinatione
by Q. Cicero.

The dialogus is dedicated to M. J unius Brutus, the conspirator,
who had been oarefully trained in philosophy by his maternal uncle
Cato, and had embraced with ardour the StoicoAcadenric doctrines
os Antiochus It is a tribute not less to thc'weight of character,
than to the philosophical attainments of Brutus, that Cicero, twenty
one years his senior, dedicated to him four ci his treatises besides the
Natura Deorum, wia the Orator, Parodana, Da Finibus and Tas-
oalanoe Disputationes, and has also introduced him as an interlocutor

l in the dialogus de claris orator-ibae which is called attor him. It
appears from the De Finibus that Brutus had previously addressed a
treatise De Virtute to Cicero ci. 1 8 ,· quem linteam helmam, oum ad te
aa Graecae quidem oedemem in philosophia audeam scribae? Quant-
qaam a te ipso id quidem facio provocatas malissimo milei libro, paam

‚ad are da virtute abaci. Quintilian speaks in high terme oi the merite
, oi the philosophica] writings of Brutus x l 5123 sufficit ponderi rorata :

‘l scias eam sentire quae dicit, with which may be compared ansar’s

judgment oi tho man, moeni refert tic quid vel-it; sed pzaioqaid volet,
no. d
