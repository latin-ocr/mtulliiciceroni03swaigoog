' t 10 bul τὸ φιὺγιιν τὴν ὅγνοιον ἐφιλοσόφησαν, ‘the great disarepanay of

opinions is an evidence that the nausa or etartingpoint of philosophy
wns the painful eomdmnnees of ignoranoe, aad that the Academias

' are justified in refusing to make any affirmation on points where oertainty

isunattainable’. (See Krische p. 7.) But this explanation is unsatis-
factory on several grounde3 (1) there is no reason for making any refer-

· enne to the origin of philosophy, (2) the present discrepanay of opinions is

no argument as to what may have been the original philosophy, (3) the
origin of philosophyis in aa way connected with the Academia principle
(itself the result oi along history oi philosophy) that man must be content

' with probability, (4) bare ignoranee is very far from being the marsa of

philosophy, aad it would be an altogether wrong use of words to make
ιἰυσιιπιίαετό φεύγειν τὴν ἄγνοιαν, (h) principium philosophandi would have

· beenamore appropriate expression for the supposed muse. Norisitmuah

more mdsfaotory to interpret the clause ae affirming that the Socratis
onnfemion of ignoranoe is the stertingpoint of philosophy in the individual
(of. Aa 144). lf we retain the ordinary reading, I think it in best to take it
as giving the saeptioal view, ‘the muse and origin of this whole windbag of
philosophy is ignoranee', of. Sext Emp. Mart. 1129 τὸ πολύτροπον τῆς

by Hortensius and othere (ria 1 2), it is hardly oonoeivable that Ο. should
have adopted it as his own. I should prefer therefore to follow Ursinus
(if one only knew what his rra was¹) or Heind, whose manag gives au
exoellent sense though somewhat olumsily expressed: ‘the disompaney of
opinions proves that they all sprung from ignoranoa and that the Aea·

· demios are right in refusing ιο make any positive assertion'. 'l’he interpo-

lation of the olause omitted by him would be easily aoeounted for by the
supposition that in priampiuna philosophae was a gloss oa the words
Amdemahne malm οοιίιοιιιοο, meaning that this was the leading prin·
eiple of their philosophy. The variety of opinione was the 10th of the
common-pluens used by the Soeptias to prove that knowledge was un-
attainable, see Sext. Emp. Hyp. 1 14 145. Baiter, in order to keep the

’ aiat of the majority of uss, inserts earn, reading deberat for debona in

apodoai, bnt this is awkward ester aura multae ,· and it is also more marra!
to introduce the discrepanoy of opinion as a ἀίειίοοι statement to be
proved by what follows, οοιιιι a'a lna quaenam, rather than to refer to it aa
