ut Cambridge, and to my former pupil, ΜΓ Η. Ρ.
Richards, now Fellow and Tutor of Wadham Collega,
Oxford ; bul above all to Mr J. S. Reid, whose

name is well known to scholare from his excellens
editions of the Academica and olher werke of Cicero,
and to my old and valued friend Mr H. J. Rohy.
The help which I have received from the two latter

is only imperfeclly represented by the additions and

corrections marked wilh the signature R, in the case
ol those supplied by Mr Roby‚ and J. S. R, in the
case of those supplied by Mr Reid. Many of my own

notes have been modified, and perhaps more should
have been, in deference 'oo their candid and searching

criticism.

The remaining volume will, I hope, be completed 1

for publication during the course of next year. 1

April, 1880.
