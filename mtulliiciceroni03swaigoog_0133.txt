ut (irasci dicunt deciperes: there seems nc reason ior doubting the
genuineness of these words, as Heind. end Ba have done; see n. on plyno-
lopiam 5 20. There is a special reason for adding the Greek hera, as the
latin equivalents were not introduced till later, incorporalis appearing
first in Seneca, incorporem in Gellius. The doctrine that all thetis
corporeal is in its own nature mortal, γεννηνὸν ecl φθαρτόν, runs through
the whole of Plato (see 5 20 n) and we find the unwan, which isetemal,
contrasted with things seen and temporal in Tira 283 but it is only the
Demiurgus who is essentially incorporeal; many of the inferior deities
are clothed iu bodies.

absence of pisaeum, see 5 48. cis own opinion is given Tace 150, where
speaking of those qui rapuerant qualis animur εἰν vocam corpore intellegere et
copilctrbne eornprehendere, he says qenai vero imelleqont piretu eit fa ipso
corpore ,· anda little further certe et ἄνοον speum sidicinum ammom corpore

argues aomina those who identified matter aud existence, ταύτὸν cripe eci
οὖσὶον ὁριζόμονοι in the Soplt. 246 foll. where the term ἇσῶμονον occurs.

τᾶργα. The passage referred tc is quoted by Clem. Al. Protr. 5 71, Sirena v
5 109, and by others among the early Christian writers: it occurs in Mea
1v 3 5 13, where Socrates says that Euthydemus will scon be convinced
of the pmvidential governmsnt of the world, if he is content to see the

οὔτᾶν ὁρῶντο σέβεσθαι καὶ τιμᾶν roda deciis, a very different assertion from
that of the Epicurean critic here, who would identify this with the view
just before attributed to Plato (doum immineri ivm pocae, ονιοοίνί acra

the same passage of the Mernoralrilio, where Socrates illustratas our·
