that ol Velleius (ξ 59). It would further seem that Cicero has pre·
sarred Zeno’s sharp sayings, which were sottened down by the gentler
Philodemus, who may also have added a good deal of his own in the
later section¹. But then why does the historical review stop at the
middle ol the snd century nel It seems as if we must go back
. a step further and traca Zeno’s criticisms to Apollodorus ὁ mord·
ραννος, the predecessor ol Zeno in the chair ol Epicurus, who flou·
risbed towards the end cf the and century nc and is said to have
written more than 400 books (Zeller Stoica tr. p. 389).

With regard to the sources of the other two sectionsI do not think

’ we are yet able tc arrive at any positive conclusion It is possible

that Zeno wrote a treatise περὶ θεῶν in four books, the lst disproring
what might be considered the orthodox theology of Plato end the
Stoice, the 2nd giving a history of the traditional beliess, the 3rd a
history of philosophicel speculation on the same subject, the ath
containing the views of the most advanced Epicuream but it is
equally possible that Phaedrus (as suggested by the letter to Atticus)
may have been the authority copied by Cicero lor his first and last
sections; on the other hand it is quite possible that 0. may hare
found bis treatise unsuited to his purpose

We procced now to inquire what is the original source of the
criticism ol Epicurus which is put in the mouth of (lette. Itis
natural at first sight to suppose that this, as wellas the criticism oi
the Stoical doctrines assigned to Cotta in the third book, ia derived
nom Clitomachus, the editor of the writings of the great Academia
critic, Carneades. But further consideration shows tbat there are
many difficulties in the way of this identification. Carneades is
quoted by name in bk. 111 29, 41, but never in bk. r, where, on tbe
contrary, we lind Posidonius referred to as the authority from whom
a partos the argument is horrowed (3123); and Schwenke has
pointed out the strong vein of Stoicism which runs through the
speech Compare for instance the jest at the expense of the Academy
iu 5 80, the definitione of samtitca and pietas in 5115, the view of
wisdom as a hond of union not only between man and man, but
between men and God ἕ 121, the idea of virtue as an active principle

earlier and later sections to Zeno. Schwenke would give all to Zeno (pp. 5657).
Diels (p. 1ae) is inclined to make Philodemus copy lrom Phaedrus, which dces
not seem to me probahle.
